                    Over the past few years, Bootstrap has become an increasingly popular front-end development framework. More and more developers and designers are using it when developing codes.

                    The Bootstrap 5 is the world’s most popular framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites, with jsDelivr and a fast starter page.

                We use Python for web development to create web-based applications. Generally, we use a combination of Python and JavaScript to accomplish this. Because it is such a difficult language to use, developers who are skilled at creating a website with Python tend to want higher salaries. Generally, only large web design companies can afford having Python web programmers on staff full-time.
                Python is known and used around the world. Huge companies like Red Hat, Yandex, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook all rely on Python. JetBrains developed PyCharm, which is the most popular integrated development environment for Python.

                    Angular is JavaScript framework written in TypeScript and its primary purpose is to develop Single Page Applications. As a framework, Angular has distinct advantages and also provides a standard framework. This allows to build large applications in a maintainable way.


Many leading companies such as Google, Nike, Upwork, HBO and others use Angular.

However, we only use Angular when necessary. it has a number of drawbacks, such as offering limited SEO options and poor accessibility for search engine crawlers.
One of the reasons companies don't often use Angular is the difficulty of porting legacy js/jquery based code to the angular style architecture. Also, updating each new version can be problematic, and some of them are not backwards compatible.

                    Now, when it comes to front-end development, we have observed that Angular is the default choice among all solutions that can be applied for business owners who wants to take their business online.

However, there is another popular front-end development framework called React JS that is an efficient, declarative, and flexible JavaScript library for building simple, fast, and scalable frontends of web applications. As per the study made by statista in 2022, Node.js is the most used framework globally, React stands second while Angular ranked 5th on the same list.
Key benefits of react js t is the speed of the development process,
easy maintainence and is flexible due to its modular structure and it's designed to provide high performance in mind. The core of the framework offers a virtual DOM program and server-side rendering, which makes complex apps run extremely fast.

        <p class="FX-justify">When creating a new website, most companies will rely on WordPress due to its 
            popularity and ease of use. Usually, these companies will choose any free 
            templates that WordPress offers to create their websites. Well, although 
            WordPress offers you many free themes, you should understand that most of 
            these themes/templates are not fully responsive. Templates might work well
             for you, but your end customers won't get the best user experience, which
              isn't good for your business.</p>

            <p>Based on the functional issues that you may encounter when using free
             WordPress templates/themes, we have developed a solid solution for you,

            If you're on a budget and don't want to spend a lot on website development, choosing pre-made themes can help you cut costs. Stick to the basic design that the pre-made layout suggests and you won't have to spend an extra coin.
            
            Easy to build and run
            Pre-made layouts also lay the foundation for your page. For this reason, you can launch your site in a short time. This is an effective way to grow your website if you want to get it up and running in a short amount of time.

            Ease of setup
            Most of the predefined layout themes will let you customize the layout to suit your business needs.
